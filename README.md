## Install
You could either just download a [release](https://github.com/LavenderPowered/LavenderEssence/releases) or you compile the server yourself using the following commands under Linux
```shell
git clone https://github.com/LavenderPowered/LavenderEssence.git
cd LavenderEssence
./gradlew build
```
The server jar will be located at `build/libs/Lavender-<VERSION>.jar`.

Note that for compiling you need to use a JDK 17.

## Usage
To run the server you need to have a Java 17 runtime installed.
Use the following command to start the server for the first time.
```shell
java -jar Lavender-<VERSION>.jar
```
This generates a `start.sh` script and a settings file with these default values:
```json5
{
  "SERVER_IP": "localhost",
  "SERVER_PORT": 25565,
  "MODE": "OFFLINE",
  "VELOCITY_SECRET": "",
  "TPS": "20",
  "CHUNK_VIEW_DISTANCE": "8",
  "ENTITY_VIEW_DISTANCE": "5",
  "TERMINAL_DISABLED": false,
  "EXTS_COMMAND_FOR_PLAYERS": false,
  "OPEN_TO_LAN": false
}
```
There is also a config file for worlds. In this edition there is only flat instance, to maintain the simplicity of this server:
```json5
{
  "ENABLE_INSTANCE": false,
  "WORLD_TYPE": "FLAT"
}
```
You have to restart the server for changes in there to take effect.

Note that this server only supports 1.20.4 clients on version 1.0.0. To allow other/multiple versions to connect you need to use a proxy (ex. Velocity) with plugins like ViaVersion.

### Restarting
Restarting the server calls the `./start.sh` script.
The generated script will restart the server with no way to access the console.
So keep in mind that you will need an extension providing remote access or use tmux/screen in the `start.sh` to access the console.


## API
This server itself does not add some API. But it features [Minestom's API](https://github.com/Minestom/Minestom) so you can use it from within extensions.
